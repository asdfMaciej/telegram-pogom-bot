It works, but you need to change line 86, 195, 196 according to your system. Don't except support from me about this project. Also need to replace notify.js.

Check the requirements from imports at start.

Oh, and and the responses are in polish, but they're just feedback that doesn't really matter.

/start time - sets notify delay, i usually set it to like 2s    
/add pokemon - adds a pokemon to notify list    
/remove pokemon - removes a pokemon from notify list

For two above commands, you could use [rzadkie/ewolucja] instead of pokemon - the first shows rare pokemon in my area, the second shows a bit less desirable pokemon, for evolution (zubat/drowzee/paras/etc)

/list - shows you the list
